Simple chat client for Twilio. Requires three environment variables set for execution. 
* AUTH_TOKEN
* ACCOUNT_SID

The Listening Number is the twilio number the application should listen to for messages and respond with. While the application is running, you may hit the r key to respond to the last message, or hit the S key to initiate a direct send.
